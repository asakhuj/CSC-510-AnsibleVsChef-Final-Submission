These scripts will download and install all the dependencies for Chef and Ansible. 

Since there are more dependencies in Chef, that means the user may have to debug comparatively more, if any of the dependencies fail. Our Ease of use testing is based on the hypothesis that the more the dependencies, the more difficult it is to use a tool in case of any failure.

To run the scripts, login with sudo privileges on Ubuntu machine :

1) chmod +x ansible-dependencies.sh

2) chmod +x chef-dependencies.sh

3) ./ansible-dependencies.sh

4) ./chef-dependencies.sh
