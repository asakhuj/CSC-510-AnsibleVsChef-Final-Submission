This python script helps us understand the various reports generated. From pylints documentation, the following are the error classes reporte by the pylinter:
  [R]efactor for a "good practice" metric violation
  [C]onvention for coding standard violation
  [W]arning for stylistic problems, or minor programming issues
  [E]rror for important programming issues (i.e. most probably bug)
  [F]atal for errors which prevented further processing
 Beyond this, pylint calculates a score out of 10 based on errors from each .py script
  
 The python script helps us understand:
  1) How many errors of each error classes were exposed
  2) What were the 10 most popular errors of each classes
  3) A score estimate per script for the entire project/
